	          			"How to win at College" by Cal Newport is one of the most amazing college advice books ever written. And before you wonder, no it was not written by a professor; it was written by a student. 
	          			</p>
	          			<p>The information was gathered throught a national survey which was answered only by the top students from top universities. Do not take our word on it! Read the book and try applying these 75 rules to your own academic life and you will see just how different and your transcript will be! Make the most of the resources available!

	          <p> Also, if you enjoyed the book you might also enjoy Cal's blog - <a class="art" href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Study Hacks</a> - it is just as interesting and adds more to the table as a lot of the newer content is not found in the book and it was written after he graduated and started teaching himself. Some of the advice can also be applied to life after college.
