				<h3><center>What do you need to know about this website</center></h3>
				<div class="data">
				<p>
					This site was written by students for students and it is meant to help you increase your productivity during term times and otherwise. 
				</p>
				<p>
					College is a beautiful, but different experience. It is unlike anything you have ever experienced before and that is why it might seem scary at first. It is like every other thing you are not familar with, but sadly you usually do not have enough time to stop and try to figure out how it works. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Having gone though this exerience ourselves, we decided to create this site to help you out a bit. College is supposed to be some of the best time of your life and it would be a pity if you were not able to enjoy properly because of stress. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The site is very simple. At the top you can see the navigation bar which will help you navigate through the few pages. We wanted to keep it simple, yet effective. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On the Resources Page you will find articles with advice. These might be reviews of books we think might help you during you college years or motivational video or even just some tools you no longer need to spend hours looking for on the web.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Books Page is filled with book recommendations. These book are meant to help you in your academic career and in your future as they offer advice and techniques easily applicable to real life to ensure a productive, organized life and productive existence. 
				</p>
				<p>Last, but not least there is our Contact Page. Feel free to use it to get in touch with us when you have any concers, questions or just to provide feedback or say hi. We look forward to hearing from you, all of you!
